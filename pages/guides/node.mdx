# Conduit node

Conduit provides fully-managed, production-grade rollups on Ethereum.

It currently supports Optimism’s open-source [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/).

### Software requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Hardware requirements

We recommend you have this configuration to run a node:

- at least 16 GB RAM
- an SSD drive with at least 200 GB free

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter problems with your node, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/conduitxyz/node/issues/new/choose) or reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/X5Yn3NzVRh):

### Supported networks

| Network      | Slug                    | Status |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | :----: |
| Zora Sepolia | zora-sepolia-0thyhxtf5e |   ✅   |
| Zora Mainnet | zora-mainnet-0          |   ✅   |
| PGN Sepolia  | pgn-sepolia-i4td3ji6i0  |   ✅   |

### Usage

1. Select the network you want to run and set `CONDUIT_NETWORK` env variable. You will need to know the `slug` of the network. You can find this in the Conduit console. For public networks you can use the table above. Example:

```sh
# for Zora Mainnet
export CONDUIT_NETWORK=zora-mainnet-0
```

Note: The external nodes feature must be enabled on the network for this to work. For the public networks above this is already set.

2. Download the required network configuration with:

```sh
./download-config.py $CONDUIT_NETWORK
```

3. Ensure you have an Ethereum L1 full node RPC available (not Conduit), and copy `.env.example` to `.env` setting `OP_NODE_L1_ETH_RPC`. If running your own L1 node, it needs to be synced before the specific Conduit network will be able to fully sync. Example:

```sh
# .env file
# [recommended] replace with your preferred L1 (Ethereum, not Conduit) node RPC URL:
OP_NODE_L1_ETH_RPC=https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co/<your-tenderly-api-key>
```

4. Start the node!

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

5. You should now be able to `curl` your Conduit node:

```sh
curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false]}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8545
```

Note: Some L1 nodes (e.g. Erigon) do not support fetching storage proofs. You can work around this by specifying `--l1.trustrpc` when starting op-node (add it in `op-node-entrypoint` and rebuild the docker image with `docker compose build`.) Do not do this unless you fully trust the L1 node provider.

You can map a local data directory for `op-geth` by adding a volume mapping to the `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  geth: # this is Optimism's geth client
    ...
    volumes:
      - ./geth-data:/data
```

### Snapshots

Not yet available. We're working on it 🏗️

### Syncing

Sync speed depends on your L1 node, as the majority of the chain is derived from data submitted to the L1. You can check your syncing status using the `optimism_syncStatus` RPC on the `op-node` container. Example:

```sh
command -v jq  &> /dev/null || { echo "jq is not installed" 1>&2 ; }
echo Latest synced block behind by: \
$((($( date +%s )-\
$( curl -s -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_syncStatus"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:7545 |
   jq -r .result.unsafe_l2.timestamp))/60)) minutes
```

### Network Stats

You can see how many nodes you are connected with the following command:

```sh
curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"opp2p_peerStats","params":[]}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:7545
```
