# OP Stack

> Conduit allows you to launch a rollup in a fraction of the time with the OP Stack. Optimism’s [documentation](https://stack.optimism.io/) will serve you well, but there are Conduit specific details you’ll need to take into account.

OP stack is the premiere open-source rollup implementation. In their [Bedrock Explainer](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/explainer/) (the latest version of OP Stack) Optimism outlines the benefits of their modular stack. You get:

- **10-100x cheaper fees** than Ethereum Mainnet
- **Interoperability** with Mainnet through trustless bridging
- **Ethereum Equivalence**, so you can use the same workflows and tooling
- Improved node performance, so you can get **thousands of transactions per second**

Below is a great primer on how the OP Stack works to bring you more performance while maintaining security.
