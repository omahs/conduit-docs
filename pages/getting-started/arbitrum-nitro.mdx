# Arbitrum Nitro

> Conduit allows you to launch a rollup in a fraction of the time with Arbitrum Nitro. Arbitrum’s [documentation](https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro) will serve you well, but there are Conduit specific details you’ll need to take into account.

Arbitrum Nitro is the one of the premiere rollup implementations on Ethereum. Their technology boasts the usual benefits of rollups, like cheaper fees, in addition to:

- **10-100x cheaper fees** than Ethereum Mainnet
  - Go even cheaper with [data availability committee support](https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-anytrust)
- **Interoperability** with Mainnet through trustless bridging and fraud proofs
- **Close** **Ethereum Compatibility**, so you can use the same workflows and tooling
- **[Stylus](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/hello-stylus-6b18fecc3a22)**, which will allow you to write smart contracts in a more performant VM with Rust, C, or other languages that can compile to WASM. These contracts can interoperate synchronously with the EVM.
